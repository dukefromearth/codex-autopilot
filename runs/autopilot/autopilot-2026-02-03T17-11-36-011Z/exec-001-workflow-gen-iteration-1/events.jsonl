Use when the user asks to \"generate a workflow\", \"create a workflow.json\", or wants a WorkflowSpec that does a described task.\n---\n\n<!--\nBusiness intent: Convert a natural-language objective into a valid `WorkflowSpec` (DAG of `agent.run` steps)\nthat this repo can execute, with sensible defaults and skill selection.\nGotcha: Your response must be *only* the JSON object (no prose, no code fences). Do not create files; the\ncaller may choose to save the JSON to disk.\n-->\n\n# Workflow Generator\n\n## Canonical sources (use if unsure)\n\n- Schema + types: `src/workflowSpec/schema.ts`\n- Example WorkflowSpec: `configs/workflows/showcase.workflow.json`\n- Cheatsheet: `.codex/skills/workflow-spec-creator/references/workflow-spec-cheatsheet.md`\n\n## Output contract (required)\n\n- Output **exactly one** JSON object (a `WorkflowSpec`).\n- **No** Markdown fences, **no** commentary, **no** leading/trailing text.\n- JSON must be valid (double quotes, no trailing commas).\n- Do **not** create or write any files (including `workflow.json`); only return the JSON object.\n- Always include: `version: 1`, `id`, `steps` (>= 1), and each step must have `id`, `type: \"agent.run\"`, `goal`.\n\n## Defaults (use unless the user overrides)\n\n- `defaults.adapterId`: `\"codex-exec\"`\n- `defaults.adapterRequest`:\n  - `model`: `\"gpt-5.2-codex\"`\n  - `modelReasoningEffort`: `\"low\"`\n  - `webSearchMode`: `\"disabled\"` (enable if websearch is useful for the task)\n- Prefer profiles:\n  - **scout**: repository discovery / mapping (skills: `researcher`)\n  - **executor**: implements changes and runs commands (skills: `task-executor`; set `sandboxMode: \"workspace-write\"` and `approvalPolicy: \"on-request\"` unless user asks otherwise)\n  - **verifier**: validates behavior (skills: `tester`)\n  - **reviewer**: checks risks/regressions (skills: `reviewer`)\n  - **architect**: interface/design trade-offs (skills: `architect`)\n  - **rewriter**: tightens prompts/outputs (skills: `prompt-rewrite`)\n\n## Skill selection rules (use only skills that exist here)\n\nUse the smallest set of skills that satisfies the request:\n\n- Planning-heavy: add `task-planner`\n- Needs repo/context research: add `researcher`\n- Needs design/interfaces/trade-offs: add `architect`\n- Needs code changes: add `task-executor`\n- Needs tests/verification: add `tester`\n- Needs critique/risk review: add `reviewer`\n- Needs rewriting a prompt/spec or tightening output format: add `prompt-rewrite`\n- Needs creating/editing a WorkflowSpec as an artifact: add `workflow-spec-creator`\n- Needs a deterministic final summary: add `informed-decision-maker` (optional)\n\nIf the request asks for skills not present, omit them and proceed with the closest available alternatives.\n\n## Step design rules (DAG)\n\n- Use clear, stable step ids: `discover`, `plan`, `design`, `implement`, `verify`, `review`, `synthesize`.\n- Parallelize only when steps are independent; otherwise express ordering with `dependsOn`.\n- If a step consumes prior work, include `dependsOn` and add a short instruction in `inputs` to use `dependencyOutputs.<depId>.outputText` as the source of truth.\n- Keep each step’s `goal` singular (one deliverable).\n\n## Common skeletons (pick the smallest that fits)\n\n- **One-shot**: single `agent.run` step when the task is simple.\n- **Repo change**: `discover → plan → implement → verify → review`.\n- **Design-first**: `discover → design → plan → implement → verify → review`.\n- **Just research**: `discover → synthesize`.\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}
