{"done":false,"reason":"The run file API still allows symlink escapes: `handleRunFile` only checks `path.resolve` prefix, so a symlink inside a run directory can point outside and bypass the intended constraint. This violates the requirement to ensure the requested path stays within the run folder and is a security risk if the server is reachable.","nextWorkflow":{"workflowId":"mvp-run-viewer-ui-iteration-4","steps":[{"id":"fix-symlink-escape","task":"use the task-executor skill. Update `handleRunFile` to resolve real paths (or reject symlinks via `lstat`) and ensure the target realpath is within the run directory realpath before streaming; keep the early 404 behavior."},{"id":"tests","task":"use the tester skill. Add a minimal test covering the symlink escape prevention (or adjust existing traversal test to include symlink), and verify transcript/manifest endpoints still behave."},{"id":"verify","task":"use the task-executor skill.
