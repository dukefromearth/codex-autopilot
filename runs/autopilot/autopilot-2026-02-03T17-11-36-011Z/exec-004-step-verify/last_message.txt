Using tester skill.

1) Objective
- Verify the MVP run viewer changes with `npm run typecheck` and `npm run test`.

2) Verification plan
- Run `npm run typecheck`.
- Run `npm run test` because behavior changed.

3) Commands run
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run test`

4) Results
- Pass: `npm run typecheck` completed with no errors.
- Pass: `npm run test` completed with 67 tests passing.

5) Gaps / next steps
- None.

Done: Typecheck and tests passed. Remaining risk: Viewer serves local files; keep server bound to localhost and treat as trusted-only.
