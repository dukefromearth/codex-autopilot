  "use the reviewer skill. Review changes for regressions, risks, missing tests/docs, and provide a concise final summary referencing modified files.\n\nOverall task: Implement an MVP run viewer UI for autopilot captures. Requirements: (1) Add a zero-deps viewer: a tiny Node HTTP server in examples/run-viewer.ts that serves a static HTML UI (no build step) and JSON APIs. (2) The UI information architecture must be: Run list (left) -> Exec list (middle) -> main panel with tabs: Overview, Graph, Output, Prompt, Events, Stderr, Transcript (Supplemental). (3) APIs (read-only, stream large files): GET /api/runs (scan runs/autopilot/*/manifest.json), GET /api/runs/:runId/manifest, GET /api/runs/:runId/file?path=<manifest-relative> (must validate path stays within the run folder), optional GET /api/transcript/:threadId (best-effort resolve ~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*-<threadId>.jsonl and stream it; if missing, return 404 with friendly message). Add a --codex-home flag to override default ~/.codex for transcripts. (4) In the UI, add 'Copy resume command' and 'Copy open transcript path' buttons where applicable. Resume command format: codex exec resume <threadId> \"<prompt>\". (5) Events tab: render events.jsonl incrementally (not loading entire file), with filter by event.type and text search. (6) Graph tab: render manifest.graph (nodes/edges) in a simple but clear way (table view is acceptable; optional SVG). Clicking a node jumps to the related exec and tab. (7) Update docs/run-data-ui.md with viewer usage: how to run it, what it reads, what is canonical vs supplemental, and security notes about serving local files. (8) No new runtime deps, minimal changes, do not change public APIs. (9) Run npm run typecheck and report results in final summary. If you touch tests or behavior, run npm run test.\n\nDependency outputs (copy/paste; may be long):\n\n--- verify (succeeded) ---\n\nUsing tester skill.\n\n1) Objective\n- Verify the MVP run viewer changes with `npm run typecheck` and `npm run test`.\n\n2) Verification plan\n- Run `npm run typecheck`.\n- Run `npm run test` because behavior changed.\n\n3) Commands run\n- `npm run typecheck`\n- `npm run test`\n\n4) Results\n- Pass: `npm run typecheck` completed with no errors.\n- Pass: `npm run test` completed with 67 tests passing.\n\n5) Gaps / next steps\n- None.\n\nDone: Typecheck and tests passed. Remaining risk: Viewer serves local files; keep server bound to localhost and treat as trusted-only.\n\nIf you make code changes, run the most relevant checks/tests and report results.\nFinish with a short 'Done' summary and any remaining risks."
