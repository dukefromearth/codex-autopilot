1) Objective
- Fix reviewer findings for the run viewer by adding abortable event streaming, strict route parsing, early 404s for missing files, and add minimal tests (plus docs update).

2) Plan to execute
- Tighten route parsing and file/transcript handling in `examples/run-viewer.ts`.
- Add abortable event stream logic in the UI script.
- Add minimal tests for traversal, transcript lookup with `--codex-home`, and abort logic.
- Update docs and run required checks.

3) Changes
- `examples/run-viewer.ts`: strict route parsing, early `stat` checks for 404s, abortable event streaming in UI, exported helpers, and main-module guard.
- `tests/runViewer.test.ts`: new tests for traversal rejection, transcript lookup with codex home, and event reload abort presence.
- `docs/run-data-ui.md`: documented viewer API surface.

4) Verification
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run test`

5) Results
- Typecheck and tests pass.
- Viewer now aborts stale event streams, routes are strictly parsed, and missing files return 404 before streaming.
- Tests cover traversal rejection, codex-home transcript lookup, and event abort logic (string-based check).

6) Questions / blockers
- None.

Done. Summary: Added strict routing + early 404s, AbortController-driven event reload cancellation, new tests, and updated run viewer docs. Remaining risk: the event reload abort test asserts HTML content (not runtime behavior), so it won’t catch future DOM wiring regressions.
