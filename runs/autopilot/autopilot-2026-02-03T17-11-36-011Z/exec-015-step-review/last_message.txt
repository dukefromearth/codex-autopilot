1) Findings (ordered by severity)
- `examples/run-viewer.ts:1016-1045` Path traversal check uses `path.resolve` + prefix match but does not guard against symlink escapes inside the run directory — a crafted artifact path or symlink in `runs/autopilot/<runId>` can expose files outside the run folder if the server is reachable. Suggested fix: resolve both the run directory and target with `fs.realpath` (or reject symlinks via `lstat`) and ensure the target realpath is within the run dir realpath before streaming.

2) Missing tests or verification gaps
- No tests for `/api/runs` listing (ordering, empty dir) or `/api/runs/:runId/manifest` success path.
- No tests for the resume command formatting (escaping) or transcript 404 “friendly message” body.

3) Questions / assumptions
- None.

4) Summary
- Main risk is symlink-based path escape in the run file streaming endpoint.
- Otherwise the MVP viewer and API surface look consistent with the stated requirements.
- Tests reported by the user were not re-run by me; I’m relying on the provided output.

Done. Remaining risks: symlink escape in `GET /api/runs/:runId/file` until mitigated.
