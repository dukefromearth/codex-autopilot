{"done":false,"reason":"Using reviewer skill.\n\n1) Findings (ordered by severity)\n- examples/run-viewer.ts:774-808 Event stream reload does not cancel the prior fetch/read; repeated reloads can interleave output or apply stale filters — add an AbortController per stream, cancel previous reader, and ignore aborted streams.\n- examples/run-viewer.ts:134-181 Route parsing uses startsWith/endsWith plus split, which accepts extra path segments (e.g., /api/runs/foo/bar/manifest) and silently resolves to foo — enforce exact path shapes with regex or segment validation for /api/runs/:runId/manifest, /api/runs/:runId/file, and /api/transcript/:threadId.\n- examples/run-viewer.ts:1008-1014 Missing file reads can return 200 with empty body because headers are sent before stream errors — stat/open first or handle the error before sending headers so missing files return 404.\n\n2) Missing tests or verification gaps\n- No tests for /api/runs/:runId/file traversal rejection and missing-file 404 behavior.\n- No tests for transcript lookup behavior, including --codex-home override and 404 message.\n- No tests for events reload abort behavior.\n\n3) Questions / assumptions\n- None\n\n4) Summary\n- Core UI meets requirements, but a few API/UX correctness gaps remain.\n- Recommend addressing abort handling, strict routing, and file-not-found semantics before calling done.","nextWorkflow":{"workflowId":"mvp-run-viewer-ui-iteration-3","steps":[{"stepId":"fix-viewer","instructions":"use the task-executor skill.
