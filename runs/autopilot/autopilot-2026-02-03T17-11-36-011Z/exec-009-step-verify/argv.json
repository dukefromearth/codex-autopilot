  "use the tester skill. Run npm run typecheck, and run npm run test if behavior changed; report results.\n\nOverall task: Implement an MVP run viewer UI for autopilot captures. Requirements: (1) Add a zero-deps viewer: a tiny Node HTTP server in examples/run-viewer.ts that serves a static HTML UI (no build step) and JSON APIs. (2) The UI information architecture must be: Run list (left) -> Exec list (middle) -> main panel with tabs: Overview, Graph, Output, Prompt, Events, Stderr, Transcript (Supplemental). (3) APIs (read-only, stream large files): GET /api/runs (scan runs/autopilot/*/manifest.json), GET /api/runs/:runId/manifest, GET /api/runs/:runId/file?path=<manifest-relative> (must validate path stays within the run folder), optional GET /api/transcript/:threadId (best-effort resolve ~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*-<threadId>.jsonl and stream it; if missing, return 404 with friendly message). Add a --codex-home flag to override default ~/.codex for transcripts. (4) In the UI, add 'Copy resume command' and 'Copy open transcript path' buttons where applicable. Resume command format: codex exec resume <threadId> \"<prompt>\". (5) Events tab: render events.jsonl incrementally (not loading entire file), with filter by event.type and text search. (6) Graph tab: render manifest.graph (nodes/edges) in a simple but clear way (table view is acceptable; optional SVG). Clicking a node jumps to the related exec and tab. (7) Update docs/run-data-ui.md with viewer usage: how to run it, what it reads, what is canonical vs supplemental, and security notes about serving local files. (8) No new runtime deps, minimal changes, do not change public APIs. (9) Run npm run typecheck and report results in final summary. If you touch tests or behavior, run npm run test.\n\nDependency outputs (copy/paste; may be long):\n\n--- implement (succeeded) ---\n\n1) Objective\n- Fix security and performance gaps in `examples/run-viewer.ts`, validate runId traversal, and update `docs/run-data-ui.md` accordingly, with required checks run.\n\n2) Plan to execute\n- Inspect `examples/run-viewer.ts` and `docs/run-data-ui.md`.\n- Harden UI rendering against XSS and fix resume command escaping.\n- Improve events streaming performance and validate runId.\n- Update docs for security behavior.\n- Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run test`.\n\n3) Changes\n- `examples/run-viewer.ts`: render manifest-derived UI via DOM text nodes (no `innerHTML` for untrusted data), shell-escape resume prompt safely for double-quoted POSIX strings, batch event streaming output to avoid quadratic DOM updates, and validate `runId` before filesystem access.\n- `docs/run-data-ui.md`: document viewer security behavior and resume command quoting expectations.\n\n4) Verification\n- `npm run typecheck`\n- `npm run test`\n\n5) Results\n- XSS exposure removed for manifest-derived UI content, resume command is shell-safe for double-quoted POSIX usage, events streaming is incremental without O(n^2) DOM writes, and runId traversal is blocked.\n- Typecheck and tests passed.\n\n6) Questions / blockers\n- None\n\nDone: Secured viewer UI rendering and file access, improved events streaming performance, and updated docs.  \nRisks: Transcript lookup still relies on best-effort filesystem discovery; unusual shell environments may still require manual review before running copied resume commands.\n\nIf you make code changes, run the most relevant checks/tests and report results.\nFinish with a short 'Done' summary and any remaining risks."
