use the reviewer skill. Review the changes for security regressions around file serving and flag any remaining risks.

Overall task: Implement an MVP run viewer UI for autopilot captures. Requirements: (1) Add a zero-deps viewer: a tiny Node HTTP server in examples/run-viewer.ts that serves a static HTML UI (no build step) and JSON APIs. (2) The UI information architecture must be: Run list (left) -> Exec list (middle) -> main panel with tabs: Overview, Graph, Output, Prompt, Events, Stderr, Transcript (Supplemental). (3) APIs (read-only, stream large files): GET /api/runs (scan runs/autopilot/*/manifest.json), GET /api/runs/:runId/manifest, GET /api/runs/:runId/file?path=<manifest-relative> (must validate path stays within the run folder), optional GET /api/transcript/:threadId (best-effort resolve ~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*-<threadId>.jsonl and stream it; if missing, return 404 with friendly message). Add a --codex-home flag to override default ~/.codex for transcripts. (4) In the UI, add 'Copy resume command' and 'Copy open transcript path' buttons where applicable. Resume command format: codex exec resume <threadId> "<prompt>". (5) Events tab: render events.jsonl incrementally (not loading entire file), with filter by event.type and text search. (6) Graph tab: render manifest.graph (nodes/edges) in a simple but clear way (table view is acceptable; optional SVG). Clicking a node jumps to the related exec and tab. (7) Update docs/run-data-ui.md with viewer usage: how to run it, what it reads, what is canonical vs supplemental, and security notes about serving local files. (8) No new runtime deps, minimal changes, do not change public APIs. (9) Run npm run typecheck and report results in final summary. If you touch tests or behavior, run npm run test.

Dependency outputs (copy/paste; may be long):

--- implement (succeeded) ---

1) Objective
- Use task-executor skill to harden run file path validation against symlink escapes while keeping the run viewer MVP intact.

2) Plan to execute
- Inspect `examples/run-viewer.ts` and related tests/docs.
- Implement realpath-based containment checks for run file access.
- Update tests/docs as needed and run required checks.

3) Changes
- `examples/run-viewer.ts`: Hardened `/api/runs/:runId/file` validation with absolute-path rejection, `realpath` containment checks, and symlink escape blocking.
- `tests/runViewer.test.ts`: Added coverage for symlink escape attempts.
- `docs/run-data-ui.md`: Clarified security note to include symlink path validation.

4) Verification
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run test`

5) Results
- Typecheck passed.
- Tests passed (70/70).
- Run file API now rejects symlink escapes and ensures resolved files stay within the run folder.

6) Questions / blockers
- None

Done: Implemented realpath-based run file validation, added symlink-escape test, and updated security notes. Remaining risks: Serving local files is still sensitive—keep the viewer bound to localhost when possible.

--- verify (succeeded) ---

1) Objective
- Run required verification checks for the run viewer MVP changes and summarize results.

2) Verification plan
- Run `npm run typecheck`
- Run `npm run test` (behavior/tests were touched)

3) Commands run
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run test`

4) Results
- Pass. `npm run typecheck` succeeded.
- Pass. `npm run test` succeeded (70/70).

5) Gaps / next steps
- None.

Done: All required checks passed. Remaining risks: None observed from verification; serving local files remains inherently sensitive as noted in docs.

If you make code changes, run the most relevant checks/tests and report results.
