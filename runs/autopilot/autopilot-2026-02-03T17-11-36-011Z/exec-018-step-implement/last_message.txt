1) Objective
- Use task-executor skill to harden run file path validation against symlink escapes while keeping the run viewer MVP intact.

2) Plan to execute
- Inspect `examples/run-viewer.ts` and related tests/docs.
- Implement realpath-based containment checks for run file access.
- Update tests/docs as needed and run required checks.

3) Changes
- `examples/run-viewer.ts`: Hardened `/api/runs/:runId/file` validation with absolute-path rejection, `realpath` containment checks, and symlink escape blocking.
- `tests/runViewer.test.ts`: Added coverage for symlink escape attempts.
- `docs/run-data-ui.md`: Clarified security note to include symlink path validation.

4) Verification
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run test`

5) Results
- Typecheck passed.
- Tests passed (70/70).
- Run file API now rejects symlink escapes and ensures resolved files stay within the run folder.

6) Questions / blockers
- None

Done: Implemented realpath-based run file validation, added symlink-escape test, and updated security notes. Remaining risks: Serving local files is still sensitive—keep the viewer bound to localhost when possible.
