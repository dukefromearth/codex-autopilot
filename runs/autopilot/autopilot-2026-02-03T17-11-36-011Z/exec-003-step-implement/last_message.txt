1) Objective
- Implement a zero-deps autopilot run viewer UI + server with required APIs, update docs, and verify with typecheck/tests.

2) Plan to execute
- Inspect repo conventions and existing manifest schema.
- Add `examples/run-viewer.ts` with HTTP server + static UI + APIs.
- Update `docs/run-data-ui.md` with viewer usage and security notes.
- Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run test`.

3) Changes
- `examples/run-viewer.ts` added zero-deps HTTP server, UI, and APIs for runs, manifest, file streaming, and transcript lookup.
- `docs/run-data-ui.md` documented viewer usage, data sources, and security cautions.

4) Verification
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run test`

5) Results
- Server/UI, APIs, and docs implemented as specified; no new deps and no public API changes.
- Done: MVP run viewer and docs updates complete; typecheck/test pass.
- Remaining risks: Viewer serves local files; keep bound to localhost for safety.

6) Questions / blockers
- None
