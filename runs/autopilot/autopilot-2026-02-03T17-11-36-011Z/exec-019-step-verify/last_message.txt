1) Objective
- Run required verification checks for the run viewer MVP changes and summarize results.

2) Verification plan
- Run `npm run typecheck`
- Run `npm run test` (behavior/tests were touched)

3) Commands run
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run test`

4) Results
- Pass. `npm run typecheck` succeeded.
- Pass. `npm run test` succeeded (70/70).

5) Gaps / next steps
- None.

Done: All required checks passed. Remaining risks: None observed from verification; serving local files remains inherently sensitive as noted in docs.
