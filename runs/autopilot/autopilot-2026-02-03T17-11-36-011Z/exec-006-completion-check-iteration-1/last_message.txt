{"done":false,"reason":"Review found correctness/security gaps in `examples/run-viewer.ts`: multiple `innerHTML` interpolations of manifest data (runs/execs/overview/graph/warnings) enable XSS in the local viewer; the “Copy resume command” string is not shell-safe for prompts containing backticks, `$`, backslashes, or quotes; events streaming appends to `textContent` per line causing O(n²) growth for large `events.jsonl`; and `runId` is not validated against path traversal (e.g., `..` can escape `runs/autopilot`). These should be fixed before marking the MVP done.","nextWorkflow":{"workflowId":"mvp-run-viewer-ui-fixes","steps":["use the task-executor skill.
