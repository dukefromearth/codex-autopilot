{"done":false,"reason":"1) Findings (ordered by severity)\n- `examples/codex-autopilot.ts:935` Transcript enrichment can duplicate spawn/interact edges after a thread is resumed: `nodeIdForThread` flips from exec-node to thread-node once multiple execs exist, and `parseTranscript` re-reads the full transcript on each exec, so the same call_id can be recorded twice with different `from/to` node IDs — provenance graph contains duplicate/ambiguous edges for resumed threads — cache parsed threadIds/transcripts or always map transcript edges to a stable thread node (or migrate earlier edges) to keep edge IDs consistent.\n\n2) Missing tests or verification gaps\n- No tests or fixtures covering transcript parsing across resumes (edge stability/deduplication).\n- Typecheck was reported as run by prior workflow; not re-verified in this review.\n\n3) Questions / assumptions\n- Should transcript-derived edges always target thread nodes (even when only one exec exists) to keep graph IDs stable, or is per-exec linkage intended?\n\n4) Summary\n- One blocking correctness issue: transcript edges can duplicate after HITL resume due to node mapping changes.\n- Docs update looks consistent with current invoke-edge behavior.\n- Review scoped to `examples/codex-autopilot.ts` and `docs/run-data-ui.md`; other modified files in the workspace were not reviewed.","nextWorkflow":{"version":1,"id":"autopilot-provenance-graph-fix","steps":[{"id":"stabilize-transcript-edges","type":"agent.run","goal":"use the task-executor skill.
