1) Objective
- Run `npm run typecheck` to verify the changes; run tests only if behavior changes or tests were touched.

2) Verification plan
- Run `npm run typecheck`.
- Skip `npm run test` because no tests were touched and no additional behavior changes are being validated here.

3) Commands run
- `npm run typecheck`

4) Results
- Pass. `tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit` completed without errors.

5) Gaps / next steps
- None.

Done. Remaining risk: None observed from typecheck; functional verification depends on runtime behavior outside type checking.
