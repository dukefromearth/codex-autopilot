{"done":false,"reason":"Findings (ordered by severity)\n- examples/codex-autopilot.ts:270,999 Missing invokes edge when completion-check returns nextWorkflow and skips workflow-gen, leaving the next iteration steps disconnected from the prior completion exec; this misses the required completion-check to next workflow invocation — suggested fix: when nextWorkflowOverride is used, emit invokes edges from the completion exec to the next workflow step execs or treat the completion exec as the workflow-gen node for edge recording.\n\nMissing tests or verification gaps\n- No automated test covering graph edge emission for nextWorkflowOverride, resume edges, or transcript spawn/interact enrichment; consider adding a small manifest.graph assertion. Typecheck was not rerun in this review.\n\nQuestions / assumptions\n- None\n\nSummary\n- Graph capture is close but misses the completion to next workflow invokes edge for reviewer-supplied workflows.\n- Prompt/argv capture and transcript enrichment look aligned with requirements.\n- Not reviewed: unrelated changes outside examples/codex-autopilot.ts and docs/run-data-ui.md.","nextWorkflow":{"version":1,"id":"autopilot-provenance-upgrade-next","steps":[{"id":"fix-invokes-edges","type":"agent.run","goal":"use the task-executor skill.
