Use when Codex needs to answer HITL questions, approve or deny scope changes, decide whether to proceed on a workflow checkpoint, or provide decision-ready guidance for manual approvals.\n---\n\n# Informed Decision Maker\n\n## Objective\n- Make a decision that is safe, explicit, and traceable to the provided context.\n- Provide a direct answer for every HITL question.\n\n## Decision workflow\n1. Extract each gate question and restate any implied constraints.\n2. Identify unknowns, risks, and impact (scope, cost, timeline, security, data access).\n3. Choose a decision: proceed or hold. If proceeding with conditions, state them.\n4. Produce answers mapped to each question and list any conditions.\n5. Record assumptions and follow-up questions needed to proceed.\n\n## Output discipline\n- Follow the caller's required schema and output format exactly.\n- When no schema is provided, output JSON with:\n  - `decision`: \"proceed\" | \"hold\"\n  - `answers`: { \"<question>\": \"<answer>\" }\n  - `notes`: concise rationale, conditions, and unknowns\n- Keep answers concise and actionable; include specific file paths or constraints when relevant.\n\n## Guardrails\n- Do not invent facts; if information is missing, say so and choose \"hold\" or define a minimal-safe assumption.\n- Be conservative on security, privacy, legal, compliance, or cost-impacting requests; require explicit approval if uncertain.\n- If a scope expansion is requested, specify exact files/areas and a rollback or containment plan.\n\n## Quality checks\n- Ensure every question has an answer.\n- Ensure the decision matches the answers and conditions.\n- Ensure assumptions, risks, and required follow-ups are explicit.\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}
