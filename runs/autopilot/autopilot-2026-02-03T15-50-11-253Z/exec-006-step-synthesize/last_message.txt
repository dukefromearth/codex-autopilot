{"decision":"hold","answers":{},"notes":"Decision-ready summary: Changes appear focused on autopilot capture graph/prompt+argv artifacts and manifest graph docs, but review flags two correctness risks in `examples/codex-autopilot.ts` (final manifest may miss invokes edges; failed step execs lose `execId`, so edges are incomplete). Verification: `npm run typecheck` not run (required by repo guidance); no tests run. Remaining risks/follow-ups: ensure graph sync before final manifest write, preserve `execId` on failure for edge linking, add/validate edges for dependsOn/invokes/resume/spawn/interact, and run `npm run typecheck` before completion. Done."}
