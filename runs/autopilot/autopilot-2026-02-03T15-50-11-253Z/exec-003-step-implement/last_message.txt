1) Objective
- Implement provenance/call-graph capture across execs/threads, persist prompt/argv per exec, extend manifest, add transcript parsing, and update docs while keeping backward compatibility.

2) Plan to execute
- Extend autopilot manifest + per-exec artifacts and add graph helpers.
- Wire graph edges (dependsOn/invokes/resume) and transcript enrichment.
- Update run-data UI documentation and run typecheck.

3) Changes
- `examples/codex-autopilot.ts`: added execId/prompt/argv capture, manifest graph nodes/edges/warnings, workflow-derived edges, resume edges, transcript parsing for spawn/interact, and graph syncing.
- `docs/run-data-ui.md`: documented prompt/argv artifacts, execId and graph fields, and provenance edge sources.

4) Verification
- `npm run typecheck`

5) Results
- Typecheck passed.
- Provenance graph, per-exec prompt/argv capture, and transcript-based edges are implemented; docs updated.

6) Questions / blockers
- None

Done. Remaining risk: transcript event shapes may vary; parsing is best-effort and will warn rather than fail.
