Your job is to carry out the user's task (or an approved plan) in this repository with minimal assumptions and strong verification.\n\nImplement to the best of your ability. Be precise with your changes and forward thinking. Don't \"overimplement\", but what you do implement should be \"incredible\".\n\n## Core principles\n\n- Be evidence-driven: inspect the repo to confirm paths, patterns, and tooling.\n- Prefer smallest viable change that meets requirements.\n- If the plan is incomplete or risky, pause and ask for clarification.\n- Keep changes auditable and reversible.\n\n## When to inspect the repo\n\nInspect the repo if any of these are true:\n- The task references files you have not located yet.\n- You need to match existing conventions or patterns.\n- Tests, lint, or build steps are unknown.\n\nUse lightweight inspection first (`ls`, `rg --files`, `rg <pattern>`, open small files). Avoid large scans unless necessary.\n\n## Execution workflow\n\n1) Restate the objective in one line.\n2) Identify the minimal set of files to touch.\n3) Inspect relevant files and tooling.\n4) Implement changes in small, reviewable steps.\n5) Verify with tests or checks.\n6) Summarize what changed and what remains.\n\n## Safety rules\n\n- Do not delete data unless explicitly requested.\n- Do not run destructive commands (e.g., `rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`) unless explicitly requested.\n- If a command might be risky, explain and ask first.\n\n## Output format (required)\n\nUse this exact structure:\n\n1) Objective\n- <one sentence>\n\n2) Plan to execute\n- <short bullet list of steps you will take>\n\n3) Changes\n- <files created/modified with brief notes>\n\n4) Verification\n- <commands run or checks performed; if none, say why>\n\n5) Results\n- <what worked, what failed, what remains>\n\n6) Questions / blockers\n- <questions if any; otherwise say \"None\">\n\n## Execution rules\n\n- Keep edits minimal and localized.\n- If tests exist, run the smallest relevant subset.\n- If you cannot run tests, explain how the user can.\n- Do not invent APIs or behaviors; confirm via code or docs.\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}

This is the handle you resume.\n- **Turn**: One prompt/response cycle inside a thread. Resuming appends a new turn to the same thread.\n- **Item**: A unit within a turn (agent message, tool call, command execution, patch apply, etc.). Some streams report explicit item boundaries.\n- **Run (local concept)**: Usually “one thread”. For a multi-step workflow, you may also want a higher-level “workflow run” that groups many threads.\n- **Workflow (local concept)**: A DAG (or ordered list) of steps where each step may be executed by its own `codex exec` thread.\n\n## Data Sources You Can Build a UI From\n\n### 1) Live event stream: `codex exec --json`\n\n- `codex exec --json ...` prints JSONL events to stdout.\n- The **first line** includes the durable id: `{\"type\":\"thread.started\",\"thread_id\":\"...\"}`.\n- This stream is the easiest way to implement “run capture” without relying on Codex’s internal persistence paths.\n\n### 2) Persisted session transcript: `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-…-<thread_id>.jsonl`\n\nCodex stores detailed JSONL logs under the Codex home directory:\n\n- Default Codex home: `~/.codex` (unless `CODEX_HOME` is set).\n- Sessions root: `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/`\n- Filename pattern includes the `thread_id` as a suffix: `rollout-…-<thread_id>.jsonl`\n\nThe persisted session transcript contains richer structured events than the `--json` stdout stream (including `turn_context`, tool call pairing, and token accounting).\n\n### 3) History index: `~/.codex/history.jsonl`\n\n`~/.codex/history.jsonl` appears to record high-level history entries (e.g., prompts) keyed by `session_id`. This can be used as a lightweight “recent runs” index, but it’s not a full-fidelity transcript.\n\n### 4) TUI log: `~/.codex/log/codex-tui.log`\n\nUseful for debugging the Codex client itself (UI issues, crashes, etc.), not primarily for run viewing.\n\n### 5) Canonical protocol schemas: `codex app-server generate-json-schema`\n\nCodex can emit JSON Schemas (and TS bindings) for its app-server protocol:\n\n- `codex app-server generate-json-schema --out <dir>`\n- `codex app-server generate-ts --out <dir>`\n\nEven if you don’t run `codex app-server` directly, these generated schemas are valuable as a **stable reference** for event payload shapes you may see in transcripts.\n\n## What You Know “Immediately” When an `exec` Starts\n\n### If you use `--json`\n\n- You immediately receive `thread_id` from `thread.started`.\n- Because you invoked the command, you also know (externally) the cwd, model, config overrides, sandbox mode, approval policy, etc.\n\n### Persisted logs confirm / enrich early metadata\n\nThe persisted session JSONL begins with `session_meta` and includes `turn_context` entries that record key runtime settings, such as:\n\n- `cwd`\n- `approval_policy`\n- `sandbox_policy`\n- `model`\n- `effort` / reasoning effort\n- collaboration settings (when relevant)\n\n## Retaining Run Metadata Elegantly (Minimal Glue)\n\nIf the UI wants to list runs reliably, don’t depend on “discovering” Codex’s internal paths at runtime. Instead:\n\n1. Always run `codex exec --json ...`\n2. Tee stdout JSONL to a file you control (a “captured stream”)\n3. Parse the first event to capture `thread_id`\n4. Write a tiny **run manifest** alongside it\n\nSuggested `RunManifest` shape (informal):\n\n```ts\ntype RunManifest = {\n  runId: string; // your own id (optional)\n  threadId: string; // Codex thread_id (required)\n  startedAt: string; // ISO\n  finishedAt?: string; // ISO\n  status: \"running\" | \"done\" | \"error\" | \"aborted\";\n  cwd: string;\n  model?: string;\n  modelReasoningEffort?: \"low\" | \"medium\" | \"high\" | \"xhigh\";\n  sandboxMode?: \"read-only\" | \"workspace-write\" | \"danger-full-access\";\n  approvalPolicy?: \"untrusted\" | \"on-failure\" | \"on-request\" | \"never\";\n  capturedJsonlPath?: string; // tee target\n  codexSessionJsonlPathHint?: string; // optional convenience hint (may be discovered later)\n};\n```\n\n### Autopilot capture layout (examples/codex-autopilot.ts)\n\nThe autopilot runner now persists **per-exec artifacts** for each `codex exec` invocation\n(workflow generation, each workflow step, completion check) and indexes them via a manifest.\nThis is the reference layout for future UI work:\n\n```\nruns/autopilot/\n  autopilot-2026-02-03T18-29-12-123Z.json        # legacy runState (back-compat)\n  autopilot-2026-02-03T18-29-12-123Z/\n    manifest.json                               # run index (see below)\n    exec-001-workflow-gen-iteration-1/\n      events.jsonl                              # raw stdout JSONL, as received\n      stderr.txt                                # raw stderr\n      last_message.txt                          # codex exec --output-last-message\n      prompt.txt                                # exact prompt string passed to codex\n      argv.json                                 # full argv array used to spawn codex\n    exec-002-step-discover/\n      events.jsonl\n      stderr.txt\n      last_message.txt\n      prompt.txt\n      argv.json\n    exec-003-completion-check-iteration-1/\n      events.jsonl\n      stderr.txt\n      last_message.txt\n      prompt.txt\n      argv.json\n      schema.json                             # optional if --output-schema is used\n```\n\n`manifest.json` (informal):\n\n```ts\ntype RunManifest = {\n  runId: string;\n  startedAt: string;

UI consumers should not guess paths.\n- Failed execs still get a manifest entry with `status:\"failed\"`, an `exitCode`, and artifact paths.\n- If `codex` fails to spawn or stdio is missing, `events.jsonl` may be empty and `threadId` may be `unknown`;\n  `stderr.txt` includes spawn/process error text when available.\n- `graph.warnings` records best-effort enrichment failures (e.g., transcript lookup/parsing misses).\n\nThis gives the UI a stable index even if Codex changes persistence conventions later.\n\n## Provenance / Call Graph (Autopilot)\n\nThe autopilot runner enriches `manifest.json` with a lightweight provenance graph that links exec\ninvocations and any discovered Codex threads (e.g., spawned collaborators):\n\n- **Nodes**:\n  - `type:\"exec\"` nodes represent each `codex exec` invocation (execId, label, threadId, artifacts).\n  - `type:\"thread\"` nodes represent additional threads discovered in transcripts when no exec node exists.\n- **Edges**:\n  - `dependsOn`: derived from `workflow.steps[].dependsOn` (dependency exec → dependent exec).\n  - `invokes`: workflow-gen → step execs, step execs → completion-check, completion-check → next workflow-gen.\n  - `resume`: emitted when an exec uses `codex exec resume` (thread state → resumed exec).\n  - `spawn` / `interact`: derived from persisted transcript `event_msg` payloads.\n- **Event sources**:\n  - `workflow` edges are inferred from the workflow DAG and iteration flow.\n  - `resume` edges are inferred from the CLI arguments used to resume a thread.\n  - `transcript` edges are best-effort from `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-…-<thread_id>.jsonl`.\n\nBest-effort transcript parsing means **missing transcripts do not fail a run**; the runner just omits\nthose edges and appends a warning in `graph.warnings`.\n\n## Transcript/Event Shapes to Support in the UI\n\nThere are (at least) two “layers” of event streams you may choose to display:\n\n### A) `codex exec --json` stream (stdout)\n\nEmpirically observed event types include:\n\n- `thread.started` (contains `thread_id`)\n- `turn.started`\n- `item.started` / `item.completed` (items include `type` like `agent_message`)\n- `turn.completed` (includes token usage summary)\n\nThis stream is great for a minimal live UI, but it may not include every structured detail you can find in persisted transcripts.\n\n### B) Persisted `~/.codex/sessions/.../*.jsonl` transcript\n\nEmpirically observed top-level record `type` values:\n\n- `session_meta` (session header; includes `id` and base instructions)\n- `turn_context` (records runtime settings for the upcoming turn)\n- `event_msg` (high-level UI events; includes token counts, deltas, etc.)\n- `response_item` (structured model output items; tool calls, messages, etc.)\n- `compacted` (context compaction marker; rare)\n\nCommon `event_msg.payload.type` values to render:\n\n- `user_message`\n- `agent_message`\n- `agent_reasoning` (UI-friendly reasoning text)\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}
