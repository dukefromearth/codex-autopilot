1) Objective
- Upgrade autopilot capture to persist prompt/argv per exec, preserve failed exec IDs for graph edges, and document graph/manifest updates.

2) Plan to execute
- Inspect autopilot runner + docs
- Implement error propagation to retain execId/threadId on failures
- Update docs
- Run typecheck

3) Changes
- `examples/codex-autopilot.ts` — added `CodexExecError` to carry execId/threadId/exitCode; step failure handling now preserves those IDs so graph edges can include failed steps.
- `docs/run-data-ui.md` — clarified failed execs still get stable execIds for graph linkage.

4) Verification
- `npm run typecheck`

5) Results
- Typecheck passed.
- Failed execs now retain execId/threadId in step results, enabling dependsOn/invokes edges for failures.
- Docs updated with stable execId note for failed execs.

6) Questions / blockers
- None.

Done
- Remaining risks: transcript discovery is still best-effort and may miss collab edges if `~/.codex/sessions` is unavailable or logs are missing.
