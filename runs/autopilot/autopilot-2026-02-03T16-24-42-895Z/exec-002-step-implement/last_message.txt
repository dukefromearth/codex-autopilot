1) Objective
- Fix transcript-derived provenance edges to be idempotent, stable on thread nodes, deduped correctly, and documented.

2) Plan to execute
- Inspect autopilot provenance graph handling and transcript parsing.
- Implement idempotent transcript enrichment, stable thread mapping, and dedupe rules with warnings.
- Update documentation and run typecheck.

3) Changes
- `examples/codex-autopilot.ts`: added per-run transcript caching, stable thread node mapping for transcript edges, dedupe key override, and call_id collision warnings.
- `docs/run-data-ui.md`: documented stable thread mapping, idempotent transcript enrichment, dedupe identity, and warning behavior.

4) Verification
- `npm run typecheck`

5) Results
- Done: transcript-derived edges now map to `thread:<thread_id>` nodes, are idempotent per thread per run, and dedupe by call_id + event type + sender/target thread_id + status with collision warnings.
- Risks: none known; behavior depends on transcript event shape consistency.

6) Questions / blockers
- None
