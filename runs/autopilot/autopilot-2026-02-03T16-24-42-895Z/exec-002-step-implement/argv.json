  "use the task-executor skill. Fix examples/codex-autopilot.ts transcript-derived provenance edges to be idempotent per threadId per autopilot run, map to stable thread:<threadId> nodes, dedupe by call_id+event type+sender/target threadId+status, record warnings for missing transcripts and duplicate call_id collisions, keep manifest.graph schema, update docs/run-data-ui.md, and avoid new deps.\n\nOverall task: Fix the remaining correctness issue in examples/codex-autopilot.ts provenance graph: transcript-derived spawn/interact edges must be stable and non-duplicated across multiple execs and resume. Requirements: (1) Make transcript enrichment idempotent per threadId per autopilot run (cache which threadIds/transcripts have been parsed so re-enrichment doesn't re-add edges). (2) Ensure transcript-derived edges always map to stable thread nodes (thread:<threadId>) for from/to, not exec nodes, so node IDs don't flip when a thread later has multiple execs. (3) Deduplicate transcript edges primarily by call_id + event type + sender/target threadId + status (prompt text should not be part of the dedup identity). (4) Keep current manifest.graph schema but update edge recording accordingly; record warnings for missing transcripts and any unexpected duplicate call_id collisions. (5) Update docs/run-data-ui.md to describe the stable mapping and dedup rules for transcript-derived edges. (6) No new deps; minimal focused change. (7) Run npm run typecheck and report results.\n\nIf you make code changes, run the most relevant checks/tests and report results.\nFinish with a short 'Done' summary and any remaining risks."
