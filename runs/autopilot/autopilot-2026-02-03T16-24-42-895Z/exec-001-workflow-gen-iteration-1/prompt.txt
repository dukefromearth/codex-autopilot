use the workflow-generator skill.

Task: Fix the remaining correctness issue in examples/codex-autopilot.ts provenance graph: transcript-derived spawn/interact edges must be stable and non-duplicated across multiple execs and resume. Requirements: (1) Make transcript enrichment idempotent per threadId per autopilot run (cache which threadIds/transcripts have been parsed so re-enrichment doesn't re-add edges). (2) Ensure transcript-derived edges always map to stable thread nodes (thread:<threadId>) for from/to, not exec nodes, so node IDs don't flip when a thread later has multiple execs. (3) Deduplicate transcript edges primarily by call_id + event type + sender/target threadId + status (prompt text should not be part of the dedup identity). (4) Keep current manifest.graph schema but update edge recording accordingly; record warnings for missing transcripts and any unexpected duplicate call_id collisions. (5) Update docs/run-data-ui.md to describe the stable mapping and dedup rules for transcript-derived edges. (6) No new deps; minimal focused change. (7) Run npm run typecheck and report results.

Output ONLY valid JSON for a workflow object with fields:
- version (1)
- id (string)
- steps: array of { id, type:"agent.run", goal, dependsOn? }

Rules:
- Keep it small (<= 8 steps). Prefer parallel research → execute → verify → summarize.
- Every step.goal MUST begin with: "use the <skill> skill."
- Use only skills that exist in this workspace.
- Use dependsOn to express data dependencies.
- If iteration > 1, focus only on remaining work (do not repeat completed steps).

Iteration: 1
