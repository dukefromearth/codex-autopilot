  "use the reviewer skill. Review for correctness, regressions, and missing tests with focus on provenance edge stability/dedup and the docs update.\n\nOverall task: Fix the remaining correctness issue in examples/codex-autopilot.ts provenance graph: transcript-derived spawn/interact edges must be stable and non-duplicated across multiple execs and resume. Requirements: (1) Make transcript enrichment idempotent per threadId per autopilot run (cache which threadIds/transcripts have been parsed so re-enrichment doesn't re-add edges). (2) Ensure transcript-derived edges always map to stable thread nodes (thread:<threadId>) for from/to, not exec nodes, so node IDs don't flip when a thread later has multiple execs. (3) Deduplicate transcript edges primarily by call_id + event type + sender/target threadId + status (prompt text should not be part of the dedup identity). (4) Keep current manifest.graph schema but update edge recording accordingly; record warnings for missing transcripts and any unexpected duplicate call_id collisions. (5) Update docs/run-data-ui.md to describe the stable mapping and dedup rules for transcript-derived edges. (6) No new deps; minimal focused change. (7) Run npm run typecheck and report results.\n\nDependency outputs (copy/paste; may be long):\n\n--- verify (succeeded) ---\n\n1) Objective\n- Run the repository typecheck to verify changes compile cleanly.\n\n2) Verification plan\n- Run `npm run typecheck`.\n\n3) Commands run\n- `npm run typecheck`\n\n4) Results\n- Pass. `tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit` completed with exit code 0.\n\n5) Gaps / next steps\n- None.\n\nDone: typecheck passes. Remaining risks: none observed.\n\nIf you make code changes, run the most relevant checks/tests and report results.\nFinish with a short 'Done' summary and any remaining risks."
