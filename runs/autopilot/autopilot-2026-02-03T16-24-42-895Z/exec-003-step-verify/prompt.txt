Overall task: Fix the remaining correctness issue in examples/codex-autopilot.ts provenance graph: transcript-derived spawn/interact edges must be stable and non-duplicated across multiple execs and resume. Requirements: (1) Make transcript enrichment idempotent per threadId per autopilot run (cache which threadIds/transcripts have been parsed so re-enrichment doesn't re-add edges). (2) Ensure transcript-derived edges always map to stable thread nodes (thread:<threadId>) for from/to, not exec nodes, so node IDs don't flip when a thread later has multiple execs. (3) Deduplicate transcript edges primarily by call_id + event type + sender/target threadId + status (prompt text should not be part of the dedup identity). (4) Keep current manifest.graph schema but update edge recording accordingly; record warnings for missing transcripts and any unexpected duplicate call_id collisions. (5) Update docs/run-data-ui.md to describe the stable mapping and dedup rules for transcript-derived edges. (6) No new deps; minimal focused change. (7) Run npm run typecheck and report results.

Dependency outputs (copy/paste; may be long):

--- implement (succeeded) ---

1) Objective
- Fix transcript-derived provenance edges to be idempotent, stable on thread nodes, deduped correctly, and documented.

2) Plan to execute
- Inspect autopilot provenance graph handling and transcript parsing.
- Implement idempotent transcript enrichment, stable thread mapping, and dedupe rules with warnings.
- Update documentation and run typecheck.

3) Changes
- `examples/codex-autopilot.ts`: added per-run transcript caching, stable thread node mapping for transcript edges, dedupe key override, and call_id collision warnings.
- `docs/run-data-ui.md`: documented stable thread mapping, idempotent transcript enrichment, dedupe identity, and warning behavior.

4) Verification
- `npm run typecheck`

5) Results
- Done: transcript-derived edges now map to `thread:<thread_id>` nodes, are idempotent per thread per run, and dedupe by call_id + event type + sender/target thread_id + status with collision warnings.
- Risks: none known; behavior depends on transcript event shape consistency.

6) Questions / blockers
- None
