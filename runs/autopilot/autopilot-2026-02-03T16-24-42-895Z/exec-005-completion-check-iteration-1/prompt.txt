Task: Fix the remaining correctness issue in examples/codex-autopilot.ts provenance graph: transcript-derived spawn/interact edges must be stable and non-duplicated across multiple execs and resume. Requirements: (1) Make transcript enrichment idempotent per threadId per autopilot run (cache which threadIds/transcripts have been parsed so re-enrichment doesn't re-add edges). (2) Ensure transcript-derived edges always map to stable thread nodes (thread:<threadId>) for from/to, not exec nodes, so node IDs don't flip when a thread later has multiple execs. (3) Deduplicate transcript edges primarily by call_id + event type + sender/target threadId + status (prompt text should not be part of the dedup identity). (4) Keep current manifest.graph schema but update edge recording accordingly; record warnings for missing transcripts and any unexpected duplicate call_id collisions. (5) Update docs/run-data-ui.md to describe the stable mapping and dedup rules for transcript-derived edges. (6) No new deps; minimal focused change. (7) Run npm run typecheck and report results.

(`examples/codex-autopilot.ts`)\n- Docs update clearly describes stable mapping and dedup rules for transcript-derived edges. (`docs/run-data-ui.md`)\n- Review scope limited to the two files above; other modified files were not reviewed.\n\nDone: No correctness/regression issues found in the reviewed scope. Remaining risks: missing tests for transcript dedup/idempotency and call_id collision warnings."

Return JSON ONLY with one of these shapes:
1) {"done":true,"summary":"..."}
2) {"done":false,"reason":"...","nextWorkflow":{...workflow json...}}

Rules:
- Be strict: done=true only if the task is actually completed.
- If not done, provide a small nextWorkflow (<= 6 steps) that finishes the remaining work.
- nextWorkflow steps should begin with: "use the <skill> skill."
